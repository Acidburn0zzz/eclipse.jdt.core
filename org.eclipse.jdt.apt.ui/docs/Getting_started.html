<h1>Getting Started</h2>
<h2>APT in Eclipse</h3>

<p>
The APT plugin adds Java 5 annotation processing support to Eclipse, by running annotation
processors written to use the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/apt/mirror/index.html">Mirror APIs</a>
inside Eclipse.
<p>
These annotation processors will then get triggered as you type inside Eclipse, provide
errors and warnings directly inside the editor, and producing normal build artifacts
just as if you were running Sun's apt tool from the commandline.

<p>
For more detailed information about how the plugin works, 
you can view the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/apt/index.html">JDT-APT project web site</a>.
</p>

<h3>Turning on Annotation Processing</h3>
You must have your project's compiler configured to use Java 5.0-level compliance
in the preferences, under Java->Compiler:

<p>
Next you need to enable annotation processing under Java->Compiler->Annotation Processing:

<p>
In this dialog you can also specify the generated source directory if desired,
and provide any processor options that are necessary.
<p>
Note that "-Aclasspath" and "-Asourcepath" options are automatically passed
to all your processors by eclipse, so it is unnecessary to provide those.

<h3>Adding Annotation Processors</h3>
You can add annotation processors to your project under Java->Compiler->Annotation Processing->Factory Path:

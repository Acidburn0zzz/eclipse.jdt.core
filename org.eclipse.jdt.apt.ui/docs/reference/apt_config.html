    <h1>
      Annotation Processing
    </h1>
    <p>Annotation processors can generate additional Java code or other files, and produce problem markers,
    based on Java 5 (JSR-175) annotations.  The Annotation Processing preference pane permits configuration 
    of preferences that apply to all processors in a project or workspace.  The <a href="factorypath.html">
    Factory Path preference pane</a> specifies which processors are enabled and permits configuration of 
    individual processors.
    <h2>
    	Generated source directory
    </h2>
    <p>Files will be generated on disk relative to the specified directory.  By default this directory
    is named &quot;.apt_generated&quot;, which causes it to be filtered out of the Package Explorer view.  
    The contents of this directory will be deleted when the project is cleaned, so it is important to only
    use this directory for files generated by processors.  Do not place any manually created files under
    this directory.
    <p>The generated source directory can only be changed in project-specific settings.  This field is
    not displayed when configuring workspace preferences.
    <h2>
    	Processor options
    </h2>
    <p>Options entered here will be available to the processors via the AnnotationProcessorEnvironment
    interface.  Certain options are automatically provided to the processors; entering them in this dialog
    will have no effect, since the automatically provided values will override any values set here.  
    The automatic options are described <a href="automatic_processor_options.html">here</a>. More
    information about processor options is in the topic on <a href="processor_options_input.html">the
    Processor Options input dialog</a>.

To be done:
- check that all wrong usages of modifiers are properly reported
- implement recovery, code assist and selection parsers
- code generation
- disassembler
- formatter
- search (indexer)
- DOM/AST
- type parameter generic or array ?

Javac issues to double-check:
- some locals are missing ranges see test25
- wrong offset for annotations on method calls

- wrong locations for I in:
	@A Map<@B String, @C List<@H String @E[] [] @G[]>> @I[] [] @J[] field;
	@A Map<@B String, @C List<@H String @E[] [] @G[]>> [] @I[] @J[] field;
I has the same location in both cases

- Initialize allTypeAnnotationContexts for TypeAnnotationCodStream only if needed
- Fix usage of annotation on dimensions for allocation expression

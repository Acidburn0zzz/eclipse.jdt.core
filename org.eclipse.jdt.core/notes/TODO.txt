To be done:
- check that all wrong usages of modifiers are properly reported
- implement recovery, code assist and selection parsers
- code generation
- disassembler
- formatter
- search (indexer)
- DOM/AST


Javac issues to double-check:
- no attribute for class literals
- no runtime type annotation on field type
	@A("Hello, World!") I field;
	A is seen as a regular annotation

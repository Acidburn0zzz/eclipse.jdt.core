To be done:
- check that all wrong usages of modifiers are properly reported
- implement recovery, code assist and selection parsers
- code generation
- disassembler
- formatter
- search (indexer)
- DOM/AST
- check the recipient binding for annotations resolution on type reference.
- type parameter generic or array ?
- add traverse method for all possible expression inside annotations (ClassScope vs BlockScope)

Javac issues to double-check:
- some locals are missing ranges see test25
- wrong offset for annotations on method calls

Classpath containers:
- extension point
- resolution
- classpath updates
- javadocs

Indexing support:
- crash recovery: restart indexing thread from scratch
- use jar timestamp for JAR indexing (no need if same one), might want
    to persist this information inside the index itself ? 
    idea: use both PATH+timestamp for encoding the index name
- check if we are losing JAR index files when removing them from the
    classpath, we should keep them around (JRE switching)
    
Javadoc comments:
- we probably want to adopt new top comment style
- check generated doc aspect (missing formatting tags)

JavaModel:
- get rid of invocations of deprecated APIs
